NODE_ENV=production
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-random-secret-key-here
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://intodayapp.netlify.app/
```

**Generate NEXTAUTH_SECRET:**
```bash
# Run this command to generate a secure secret
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### **Step 4: Add Database (Supabase)**

- **Database URL**: `postgresql://postgres:HP}'k6[zH14dn62`Ft!Z£7@host:port/postgres`

### **Step 5: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)**

#### **5.1 Add Custom Domain**
1. In Netlify dashboard → Your site → **Site settings** → **Domain management**
2. Click **"Add custom domain"**
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `intoday.yourdomain.com`)
4. Follow DNS configuration instructions

#### **5.2 DNS Configuration**
Add these DNS records to your domain provider:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: intoday (or subdomain of choice)
Value: your-site-name.netlify.app
```

### **Step 6: Environment Configuration**

#### **6.1 Update Environment Variables**
Add database connection to Netlify variables:
```bash
# Add to Netlify environment variables:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@host:port/postgres
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
NODE_ENV=production
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

#### **6.2 Update Authentication URLs**
In your code, update any hardcoded URLs:
```typescript
// In lib/auth-service.ts or similar files
const baseUrl = process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL || 'http://localhost:3001'
```

### **Step 7: Deploy and Test**

#### **7.1 Trigger Deployment**
Netlify automatically deploys when you push to GitHub:
```bash
# Make a small change and push
git add .
git commit -m "Configure for Netlify deployment"
git push origin main
```

#### **7.2 Monitor Deployment**
1. Go to Netlify dashboard → Your site
2. Click **"Deploys"** tab

# 1. Make changes locally
# 2. Test locally
npm run dev

# 3. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin main

# 4. Netlify automatically deploys
# 5. Test production deployment
```

#### **8.2 Environment Management**

- Free tier: 100GB bandwidth, 300 build minutes
- Upgrade to paid plan when needed

### **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

#### **Issue 1: Build Failures**
```bash
# Check build logs in Netlify dashboard
# Common fixes:
- Update package.json dependencies
- Check for TypeScript errors
- Verify environment variables
- Check Node.js version compatibility
```

#### **Issue 2: Database Connection Issues**
```bash
# Verify DATABASE_URL in Netlify variables
# Check Supabase project status
# Ensure database is accessible from Netlify
```

#### **Issue 3: Authentication Issues**
