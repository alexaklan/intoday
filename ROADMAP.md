## Notes

This roadmap is a living document. Features can be added, removed, or reprioritized based on user feedback and business requirements.

**Current Status:** Frontend application is feature-complete with authentication, user management, organisation management, and super admin functionality. Ready for backend development and data persistence.

**Next Priority:** Deploy to Netlify for production hosting and backend development

## üöÄ **Deployment Guide: Git + Netlify Setup**

### **Step 1: Git Setup & GitHub Repository**

#### **1.1 Initialize Git (if not already done)**
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory

```

### **Step 2: Netlify Account Setup**

#### **2.1 Create Netlify Account**
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Click **"Sign up"** ‚Üí **"Sign up with GitHub"**
3. Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub account
4. Complete account setup

#### **2.2 Netlify Dashboard Overview**
- **Sites**: Your deployed applications
- **Functions**: Serverless functions
- **Domains**: Custom domain management
- **Forms**: Form handling (if needed)
- **Settings**: Environment variables and config

### **Step 3: Deploy Frontend to Netlify**

#### **3.1 Create New Site**
1. In Netlify dashboard, click **"Add new site"**
2. Select **"Import an existing project"**
3. Choose **"Deploy with GitHub"**
4. Select your `intoday` repository

#### **3.2 Configure Build Settings**
Netlify will auto-detect Next.js, but verify these settings:
```bash
# Build settings (auto-detected):
Build command: npm run build
Publish directory: .next
Node version: 18.x (or latest)
```

#### **3.3 Set Environment Variables**
In Netlify dashboard ‚Üí Your site ‚Üí **Site settings** ‚Üí **Environment variables**:
```bash
# Add these environment variables:
NODE_ENV=production
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-random-secret-key-here
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-site-name.netlify.app
```

**Generate NEXTAUTH_SECRET:**
```bash
# Run this command to generate a secure secret
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### **Step 4: Add Database (Supabase)**

#### **4.1 Create Supabase Project**

- **API Key**: `eyJ...` (anon/public key)
- **Service Role Key**: `eyJ...` (secret key)
- **Database URL**: `postgresql://postgres:password@host:port/postgres`

### **Step 5: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)**

#### **5.1 Add Custom Domain**
1. In Netlify dashboard ‚Üí Your site ‚Üí **Site settings** ‚Üí **Domain management**
2. Click **"Add custom domain"**

4. Follow DNS configuration instructions

#### **5.2 DNS Configuration**
Add these DNS records to your domain provider:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: intoday (or subdomain of choice)
Value: your-site-name.netlify.app
```

### **Step 6: Environment Configuration**

#### **6.1 Update Environment Variables**
Add database connection to Netlify variables:
```bash
# Add to Netlify environment variables:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@host:port/postgres
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
NODE_ENV=production
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

#### **6.2 Update Authentication URLs**
In your code, update any hardcoded URLs:
```typescript
// In lib/auth-service.ts or similar files
const baseUrl = process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL || 'http://localhost:3001'
```

### **Step 7: Deploy and Test**

#### **7.1 Trigger Deployment**
Netlify automatically deploys when you push to GitHub:
```bash
# Make a small change and push
git add .
git commit -m "Configure for Netlify deployment"
git push origin main
```

#### **7.2 Monitor Deployment**
1. Go to Netlify dashboard ‚Üí Your site
2. Click **"Deploys"** tab
3. Watch the build logs in real-time
4. Deployment typically takes 2-3 minutes

#### **7.3 Test Production Application**
1. Visit your Netlify URL: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`
2. Test login functionality
3. Test all admin features
4. Verify database connectivity (once backend is added)

### **Step 8: Ongoing Development Workflow**

#### **8.1 Development Process**
```bash
# 1. Make changes locally
# 2. Test locally
npm run dev

# 3. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin main

# 4. Netlify automatically deploys
# 5. Test production deployment
```

#### **8.2 Environment Management**

- **Production**: Netlify handles automatically
- **Environment Variables**: Managed in Netlify dashboard
- **Database**: PostgreSQL managed by Supabase

### **Step 9: Monitoring and Maintenance**

- **Deployments**: Deployment history and rollback
- **Functions**: Serverless function management
- **Forms**: Form submission handling

#### **9.2 Cost Monitoring**
- Monitor usage in Netlify dashboard
- Free tier: 100GB bandwidth, 300 build minutes
- Upgrade to paid plan when needed

### **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

#### **Issue 1: Build Failures**
```bash
# Check build logs in Netlify dashboard
# Common fixes:
- Update package.json dependencies
- Check for TypeScript errors
- Verify environment variables
- Check Node.js version compatibility
```

#### **Issue 2: Database Connection Issues**
```bash
# Verify DATABASE_URL in Netlify variables
# Check Supabase project status
# Ensure database is accessible from Netlify
```

#### **Issue 3: Authentication Issues**
```bash
# Verify NEXTAUTH_URL matches your domain
# Check NEXTAUTH_SECRET is set
# Ensure cookies are working in production
# Check SameSite cookie settings for HTTPS
```

### **Next Steps After Deployment**
