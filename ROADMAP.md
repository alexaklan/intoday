## Notes

This roadmap is a living document. Features can be added, removed, or reprioritized based on user feedback and business requirements.

**Current Status:** Frontend application is feature-complete with authentication, user management, organisation management, and super admin functionality. Ready for backend development and data persistence.

**Next Priority:** Deploy to Railway for production hosting and backend development

## üöÄ **Deployment Guide: Git + Railway Setup**

### **Step 1: Git Setup & GitHub Repository**

#### **1.1 Initialize Git (if not already done)**
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /Users/alexkozak/Documents/workday.io

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete intoday frontend with authentication and admin panels"
```

#### **1.2 Create GitHub Repository**
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the **"+"** button ‚Üí **"New repository"**
3. Repository name: `intoday` (or your preferred name)
4. Description: `Office schedule management application`
5. Set to **Public** (for free hosting)
6. **Don't** initialize with README (we already have files)
7. Click **"Create repository"**

#### **1.3 Connect Local Repository to GitHub**
```bash
# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/intoday.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### **Step 2: Railway Account Setup**

#### **2.1 Create Railway Account**
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click **"Login"** ‚Üí **"Login with GitHub"**
3. Authorize Railway to access your GitHub account
4. Complete account setup

#### **2.2 Railway Dashboard Overview**
- **Projects**: Your applications
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL instances
- **Domains**: Custom domain management
- **Settings**: Environment variables and config

### **Step 3: Deploy Frontend to Railway**

#### **3.1 Create New Project**
1. In Railway dashboard, click **"New Project"**
2. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. Choose your `intoday` repository
4. Railway will auto-detect it's a Next.js project

#### **3.2 Configure Deployment**
Railway will automatically:
- ‚úÖ Detect Next.js framework
- ‚úÖ Install dependencies (`npm install`)
- ‚úÖ Build the application (`npm run build`)
- ‚úÖ Start the server (`npm start`)

#### **3.3 Set Environment Variables**
In Railway dashboard ‚Üí Your project ‚Üí **Variables** tab:
```bash
# Add these environment variables:
NODE_ENV=production
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-random-secret-key-here
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app-name.railway.app
```

**Generate NEXTAUTH_SECRET:**
```bash
# Run this command to generate a secure secret
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### **Step 4: Add PostgreSQL Database**

#### **4.1 Create Database**
1. In your Railway project dashboard
2. Click **"New"** ‚Üí **"Database"** ‚Üí **"PostgreSQL"**
3. Railway will provision a PostgreSQL database
4. Note the connection details (you'll need these later)

#### **4.2 Database Connection Details**
Railway will provide:
- **Host**: `containers-us-west-xxx.railway.app`
- **Port**: `5432`
- **Database**: `railway`
- **Username**: `postgres`
- **Password**: `auto-generated`
- **Connection URL**: `postgresql://postgres:password@host:port/railway`

### **Step 5: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)**

#### **5.1 Add Custom Domain**
1. In Railway project ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Domains**
2. Click **"Custom Domain"**
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `intoday.yourdomain.com`)
4. Follow DNS configuration instructions

#### **5.2 DNS Configuration**
Add these DNS records to your domain provider:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: intoday (or subdomain of choice)
Value: your-app-name.railway.app
```

### **Step 6: Environment Configuration**

#### **6.1 Update Environment Variables**
Add database connection to Railway variables:
```bash
# Add to Railway environment variables:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@host:port/railway
NODE_ENV=production
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

#### **6.2 Update Authentication URLs**
In your code, update any hardcoded URLs:
```typescript
// In lib/auth-service.ts or similar files
const baseUrl = process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL || 'http://localhost:3001'
```

### **Step 7: Deploy and Test**

#### **7.1 Trigger Deployment**
Railway automatically deploys when you push to GitHub:
```bash
# Make a small change and push
git add .
git commit -m "Configure for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

#### **7.2 Monitor Deployment**
1. Go to Railway dashboard ‚Üí Your project
2. Click **"Deployments"** tab
3. Watch the build logs in real-time
4. Deployment typically takes 2-5 minutes

#### **7.3 Test Production Application**
1. Visit your Railway URL: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`
2. Test login functionality
3. Test all admin features
4. Verify database connectivity (once backend is added)

### **Step 8: Ongoing Development Workflow**

#### **8.1 Development Process**
```bash
# 1. Make changes locally
# 2. Test locally
npm run dev

# 3. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin main

# 4. Railway automatically deploys
# 5. Test production deployment
```

#### **8.2 Environment Management**
- **Local Development**: `npm run dev`
- **Production**: Railway handles automatically
- **Environment Variables**: Managed in Railway dashboard
- **Database**: PostgreSQL managed by Railway

### **Step 9: Monitoring and Maintenance**

#### **9.1 Railway Dashboard Features**
- **Metrics**: CPU, RAM, and bandwidth usage
- **Logs**: Real-time application logs
- **Deployments**: Deployment history and rollback
- **Settings**: Environment variables and configuration

#### **9.2 Cost Monitoring**
- Monitor usage in Railway dashboard
- $5 monthly credit should last months
- Upgrade to paid plan when needed

### **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

#### **Issue 1: Build Failures**
```bash
# Check build logs in Railway dashboard
# Common fixes:
- Update package.json dependencies
- Check for TypeScript errors
- Verify environment variables
```

#### **Issue 2: Database Connection Issues**
```bash
# Verify DATABASE_URL in Railway variables
# Check PostgreSQL service status
# Ensure database is provisioned
```

#### **Issue 3: Authentication Issues**
```bash
# Verify NEXTAUTH_URL matches your domain
# Check NEXTAUTH_SECRET is set
# Ensure cookies are working in production
```

### **Next Steps After Deployment**

1. **‚úÖ Frontend deployed and accessible**
2. **üîÑ Add backend API routes** (Next.js API routes)
3. **üîÑ Connect to PostgreSQL database**
4. **üîÑ Implement data persistence**
5. **üîÑ Add real-time features**
6. **üîÑ Set up monitoring and alerts**
